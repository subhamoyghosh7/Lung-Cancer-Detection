# Lung-Cancer-Detection
- Raw data of CT scan images were there  for 50 patient.
- I have labelled them as Cancerous and non-cancerous images using DICOM.
- Then I have created 2 folders named Train and Test.
- Then I have created classifiaction model to predict if the patient is having cancer or not.
